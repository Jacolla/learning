This is the project to make my Personal CV to the sector of Software Development.

I would like to start in this world... after almost, all my life playing with PC, fixing Software problems,
Hadware problems, even once, i had to bake the graphic card, because it needed a hit of heat for some welds.
Most of what i had done was for fun, being fair, looking for a way to get a game without pay for it, and i should say
that, between the cracker's and the gamers comunity ( the wild's one's... ) it's pretty easy to get a game without pay... even online!


Anyway, i would like to start in this sector, so I'm on my way.
